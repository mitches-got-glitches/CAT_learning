    "# Challenge 1 - List Ends\n",
    "\n",
    "The first challenge this week is:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Write a program that takes a list of numbers (for example, `a = [5, 10, 15, 20, 25]`) and makes a new list of only the first and last elements of the given list. For practice, write this code inside a function.\n",
    "\n",
    "The concepts covered in this challenge are:\n",
    "* Lists and properties of lists\n",
    "* Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "To complete this challenge properly you must create a function/s. For an extra challenge execute the function within a `main()` function and then add it within the `if __name__ == \"__main__\"` boilerplate code to ensure it only executes when you run the script as the `\"__main__\"` module i.e. cliking \"run\" on that module and not importing it. I'll repeat the section from last week on this below.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Negative indexing\n",

    "### Controlling flow with `main()`\n",
    "A nice benefit of having everything in functions is that you can control the execution of your code. When a function is defined the code is not run, it's only run when it's called.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typical practice in functional programming, is to have one function called `main()` which calls all the necessary functions for the module to perform it's task. You will see examples of this when you look at the solutions to this weeks challenges.\n",
    "\n",

   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "This piece of code is necessary to control the execution of a module when importing the module from another. When you use `import` to import a module, the code in that module is executed (only once per Python session). If you are not controlling your flow of execution with the code above, then all the code that is not within functions will be executed. There might be a load of print statements that we don't want to see. It may initiate a game and ask for user input. We don't want this - we just want access tto the functions, classes and variables within the module.\n",
    "\n",
    "Essentially, what the boilerplate code above tells Python to do, is to only execute `main()` if the module is being run directly. In this instance, Python sets the internal attribute `__name__` to `\"__main__\"`, hence why we have the conditional above checking for equality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, if you are importing this module into another, it will load the functions into the namespace of your import, but it won't actually execute any of the code (until you tell it to!).\n",

    "* (w3schools Python tutorial on functions)[https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_functions.asp]\n",
    "* (w3schools Python tutorial on scope)[https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_scope.asp]\n",
    "\n",
    "##### A quick few points on scope\n",
    "\n",
    "A variable is only available from inside the region it is created. This is called scope. The order of Python scope is defined as LEGB (Local, Enclosing, Global, Built-in). When you define a variable inside a function you are creating in the local scope for that function. Therefore when the function finishes exiting that local variable will no longer be available (unless it is returned using `return` to the enclosing scope or global scope). If the variable being used doesn't exist in the scope where the code is being executed, then Python will look in the outer scopes in turn to see if it kind find a variable of that name. If it doesn't exist you will get an error. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is generally good practice to avoid using global variables and keep execution within functions using local variables or function arguments.\n",
