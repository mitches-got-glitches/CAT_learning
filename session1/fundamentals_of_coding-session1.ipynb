    "| **Computer**     | A machine that can be instructed to carry out sequences of arithmetic of logical operations automatically. |\n",

    "| **Memory / Primary Storage** | The computer hardware integrated circuits that store infomation for immediate use in a computer or CPU. A common form is random-access memory (RAM).<ul><li> Operates at high speeds when reading and writing data or machine code.</li><li>Volatile - only initialises at start-up and is wiped clean when powered down.</li></ul>\n",

    "| **Machine Code** | The only language a computer can process directly without previous transformation. True machine code is a stream of raw, usually binary data. |\n",

    "| **Algorithm** | An algorithm is a sequence of instructions to perform a computation. It can be expressed within a finite amount of space and time in a formal language. When executed it proceeds through a finite number of well defined successive states, eventually producing an output and terminating at the final state. |\n",

    "### What is Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a popular programming language created by Guido van Rossum and released in 1991.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is used for:\n",
    "\n",
    "* web development (server-side),\n",
    "* software development,\n",
    "* mathematics,\n",
    "* system scripting.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What can Python do?\n",
    "* Python can be used on a server to create web applications.\n",
    "* Python can be used alongside software to create workflows.\n",
    "* Python can connect to database systems. It can also read and modify files.\n",
    "* Python can be used to handle big data and perform complex mathematics.\n",
    "* Python can be used for rapid prototyping, or for production-ready software development.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Python?\n",
    "* Python works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc).\n",
    "* Python has a simple syntax similar to the English language.\n",
    "* Python has syntax that allows developers to write programs with fewer lines than some other programming languages. \n",
    "* Python runs on an interpreter system, meaning that code can be executed as soon as it is written. This means that prototyping can be very quick.\n",
    "* Python can be treated in a procedural way, an object-orientated way or a functional way.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Good to know\n",
    "* The most recent major version of Python is Python 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Python Syntax compared to other programming languages\n",
    "* Python was designed for readability, and has some similarities to the English language with influence from mathematics.\n",
    "* Python uses new lines to complete a command, as opposed to other programming languages which often use semicolons or parentheses.\n",
    "* Python relies on indentation, using whitespace, to define scope; such as the scope of loops, functions and classes. Other programming languages often use curly-brackets for this purpose.\n",
